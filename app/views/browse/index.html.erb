    <h1>Browse the Registers</h1>
    <p>You can browse the entries in a number of ways. To browse the records themselves, click on the 
    ‘Registers’ or ‘Related documents’ icons below, and navigate to the registers, records or time periods 
    you are interested in.</p>
    <p>You can also browse our indexes of people, places, religious houses and groups and subject headings 
    to find relevant example data on a huge range of topics. Please note that at this stage not all entries 
    have been fully indexed in this way. If you are looking at a particular topic, you might want to try an 
    <a href="/search/advanced">Advanced Search</a> instead.</p>
